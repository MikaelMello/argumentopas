About PAS
----------
This exam is divided into 3 steps (during the 3 years of high-school). In each step the student takes an exam with different kinds of questions and an essay to be written. He receives his grades, and at the end of high-school, his grades are calculated into a final argument using an algorithm that can be found [here (pages 16 and 17)](http://www.cespe.unb.br/pas/arquivos/PAS%201%20Abt%202015-2017.pdf).
